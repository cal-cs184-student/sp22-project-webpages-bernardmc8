	<p>2.1: Playing around with some values of ks, density, damping</p>
	<p>First, here is pinned2.json with default parameters (density: 15 g/cm^2, ks: 5,000 N/m, damping: 0.2%)</p>
	<img src="images/task2_1.png">
	<p>2.1 (cont.): Playing with values of ks </p>
	<p>In general, the value of ks describes the stiffness of the spring. When we increase the value of ks, we increase the stiffness of the springs: that is, it requires more force in order to change the length of the spring. </p>
	<p>When looking at pinned2 mid-fall with ks 5,000 N/m, we see a crease form in the middle of the sheet as a result of gravity pulling the middle down but the corners being pinned (the image below is the same as the default one above). </p>
	<img src="images/task2_1.png">
	<p>When we increase ks to 50,000 N/m, we see that at a similar position of the sheet mid-fall, there is no longer a crease in the middle of the sheet (note that there is a crease in the beginning of the fall but the crease disappears faster). That is because, the stiffer the spring, the more resistant to force the springs will be. Intuitively, this visual difference makes sense. You can imagine a sheet with infinite ks as acting as one distinct object, like a slab of wood instead of a sheet. In this case, the slab of wood would just hinge on the two points and essentially rotate flatly without changing shape. So basically, as we increase ks, the sheet acts more and more like a solid slab of wood in that the shape is more resistant to change. </p>
	<img src="images/task2_3.png">
	<p>When we decrease ks to 5 N/m, the opposite happens. The springs are less rigid so the sheet as a whole changes shape more. We can see this in the scene as the crease in the middle of the sheet at a given position as it is falling is deeper than with the default ks. </p>
	<img src="images/task2_6.png">
	<p>Also, there is much less of a "shelf" where the sheet folds over horizontally once the sheet has fallen</p>
	<img src="images/task2_4.png">
	<p>2.1 (cont.): Playing with values of density </p>
	<p>In general, the value of density visually does the opposite of what the value of ks does.</p>
	<p>When we decrease the density to 1 g/cm^2, we see that the crease in the middle of the sheet disappears very quickly into the fall </p>
	<img src="images/task2_7.png">
	<p>Conversely, when we increase the density to 150 g/cm^2, the crease is deeper at a similar point of the fall</p>
	<img src="images/task2_8.png">
	<p>2.1 (cont.): Playing with values of damping </p>
	<p>Generally, the damping parameter controls how much the springs can bounce back so a higher damping percentage means the springs are really free to bounce back and forth while a lower damping percentage means the springs reach equilibrium very quickly </p>
	<p>When we increase the damping percentage to 100%, the sheet just swing falls and then instead of coming to rest fairly quickly, it way overshoots just laying vertical and swings back and forth like a swing on a playground. </p>
	<img src="images/task2_9.png">
	<p>When we decrease the damping percentage to 0%, it falls extremely slowly and then comes to rest without having to really move too far and then swing back. Visually, it appears to reach equilibrium without even having to overshoot and then correct back by swinging the opposite direction.</p>

	<p>2.2: pinned4 in final resting state with default parameters: </p>

	<p><big> Part 3: </big></p>
	<p>3.1: sphere.json in final resting state with various ks values </p>

	<img src="images/task3_50000.png">
	<p>As we decrease ks, the stiffness of the spring decreases, so the lower the ks, the more cloth visually drapes over the sphere. As we increase ks, it requires more force to pull the springs the same distance, so since the magnitude of gravity pulling down doesn't change, we can see that the higher ks valued scenes have a cloth that is more rigid. Again, one way to think about this is the higher the ks, the closer the cloth would be to just a wooden slab, and a wooden slab would just lay horizontally flat on top of the sphere. In conclusion, basically decreasing ks makes the cloth drape over the ball more and increasing ks makes the cloth more rigid. </p>

	<p>4.2: selfCollide.json cloth falling with various parameters</p>
	<p>Generally, ks affects the self-collision of the cloth in that the higher the ks, the higher the rigidity of the springs, so the cloth is more resistant to change. That is why, in the higher ks scene, the cloth only has a couple of large folds whereas the lower ks scene has many folds. Again, one way to think about ks is that if ks was infinitely high, the cloth would behave like a slab, and a slab falling on itself would have no folds, so generally, the higher the ks the less folds would be in the resting cloth and the lower the ks the more folds would be in the resting cloth. However, I will say that number of folds and ks is not exactly a direct correlation, due to how the cloth falls this relationship might be slightly different but generally, comparing very high ks and very low ks this will be true. </p>
	<p>High KS:</p>

	<p>Low KS:</p>
	<img src="images/task4_lowks.png">
	<p>Generally, density acts oppositely to ks. The higher the density the more folds the resting cloth will have and the lower the density the less folds the resting cloth will have. We can see this in the images, especially in the low density image, which has a very straight piece of cloth at the end.</p>
